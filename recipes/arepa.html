        <ul>
            <li class="instruction">2 cups precooked white cornmeal (Harina P.A.N. is the traditional brand)</li>
            <li class="instruction">2 ½ cups warm water</li>
            <li class="instruction">1 tsp salt</li>
            <li class="instruction">1 tbsp oil (vegetable or corn oil, optional, for a softer dough)</li>
            <li class="instruction">Shredded beef (prepared as carne mechada, usually stewed with onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomato, and spices)</li>
            <li class="instruction">Soft white cheese (queso blanco or queso de mano; mozzarella can be used if unavailable)</li>
            <li class="instruction">Ham slices</li>

        <ol>
            <li class="instruction">In a large bowl, add the warm water and dissolve the salt. Slowly add the precooked cornmeal while stirring with your hands or a spoon to avoid lumps. Knead gently until you get a smooth, pliable dough that doesn't stick to your hands. Let it rest for 3–5 minutes.</li>
            <li class="instruction">Divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten into a disk about ½ - ¾ inch thick.</li>
            <li class="instruction">Heat a lightly oiled skillet (griddle) over medium heat. Place the arepas and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, until a golden crust forms. Transfer to a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10–15 minutes to finish cooking (they should sound hollow when tapped).</li>
            <li class="instruction">Slice open each hot arepa halfway to form a pocket. Spread a bit of butter inside. Fill generously with shredded beef. Add slices of ham and a good portion of soft white cheese. Serve immediately while warm.</li>
        </ol>
